**Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)** 

CLTV represents the total amount of money a customer is expected to spend in a business during his/her lifetime. This is an important metric to monitor because it helps to make decisions about how much money to invest in acquiring new customers and retaining existing ones.
 
My task was to : Predict the lifetime value of customers for a business based on their historical interactions.
So, in this project I have used linear regression to make predictions and at the end of the project I have also showed metrics graph representation for the same with the help of  r2_score, median_absolute_error
